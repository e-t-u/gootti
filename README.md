Gothic handwriting font

This is a font for gothic handwriting in 18th and 19th centuries.

-- Only lowercase letters at this time! --

This writing was used mainly in Germany but my main interest is to the variant that was used in Finland and Scandinavia
to write down church records (births, marriages and deaths). The samples I have of German variant and Scandinavian
variant differ only slightly.

The script used earlier in 16th and 17th centuries was still quite different - and even less readable
to a modern reader.

I am not expert in this writing. I have just some unclear examples and it is difficult to say exactly how the
curves should go. Typical to this era was the use of individual creativity. The same letter can be written
differently in the same page.

The big difference in my Scandinavian samples and German samples is that in German samples some edges are sharp
and in Scandinavia they are curved. I have mixed some of these and used the one that was easier to draw.
I am not sure if that is acceptable for experts. In some glyphs there are several different alternatives where
only one is chosen.

Gothic scripts have two letters "s". In case of double s, one variant is used as the first letter and another
as the second letter. In this font, only the simplest alternative is available.
